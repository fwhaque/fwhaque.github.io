This was a project for a 3rd year product design course at the University of Waterloo. It explores the space of gesture based data transfer between devices.

Proxima is a non-intrusive, wearable glove that allows for the transfer of data between devices through the use of physical gestures that mimic the actions of handling physical files. By performing grabbing gestures in front of the screen of the device, a selected file will be copied onto Proxima. A separate release gesture can then be used to transfer the copied data onto a second device. Proximaâ€™s implementation was divided into five key sections: communication layer, micro-controller accessories, computer interaction research, glove design and user interface creation.<br><br>
