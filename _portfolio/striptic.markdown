This project was undertaken while on a research exchange to Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile in Toulouse, France. The exchange was part of the <a href="http://www.leif-exchange.org/projects/past/fhaque" target="blank">LEIF program</a>.

Strip'tic is a tangibile-UI air traffic control terminal combining traditional paper strips with digital augmentation via a projection system. Input is multi-modal with both multi-touch and Anoto pens being accepted.

The semester was spent primarily on porting in-house image processing algorithms over to openCV, implementing fiducial marker tracking, and exploring FTIR/DI multitouch systems.<br><br>
